# Anomaly-Detection
This machine learning model detects and notifies the security team whenever a login activity significantly deviates from the user’s historical behavior. Unlike the risk score model, this system does not block access — it only sends alerts, ensuring that legitimate but unusual actions (e.g., emergencies, travel) are still permitted.
